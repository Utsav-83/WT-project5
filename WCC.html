             • Event: FIDE World Chess Championship 2000<br>
             • Venue: Tehran, Iran, and New Delhi, India<br>
            • Date: November–December 2000<br>
            • Format: Knockout tournament format<br><br>
            
            This championship was held under the FIDE format that used a knockout system, rather than the traditional match format between a reigning champion and a challenger.

             Finalists<br>
             • Vishwanathan Anand (India): Already a strong contender and former challenger for the title (he played against Garry Kasparov in 1995), Anand was widely considered one of the top players of his era.<br>
             • Alexei Shirov (Latvia/Spain): Known for his creative and aggressive style, Shirov had defeated Vladimir Kramnik in a 1998 match to earn the right to challenge Garry Kasparov for the Classical World Chess Championship. However, that match never materialized.<br>

      Background<br>
      <br> The division of the World Chess Championship began in 1993 when Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short played their match outside
       FIDE's jurisdiction,<br> leading to a schism in the chess world. Between 1993 and 2006, various players held the FIDE title 
       but were often not recognized as legitimate champions <br>by the classical chess community. The 2006 match aimed to unify these
        titles by having Kramnik defend his title against Topalov23.<br><br>
      Match Format<br>
      The championship consisted of 12 classical games. If the score was tied at 6-6 after these games,
      <br> a tiebreak consisting of rapid games would determine the winner. The first player to reach 6 points would win the match4.<br><br>

       <p style="font-size: 1.5em;"><br> Key Events and Controversies<br>
      Toiletgate: A significant controversy arose during the match regarding Kramnik's frequent visits to the restroom,
       which Topalov's team alleged were <br>attempts to receive outside assistance. This led FIDE to mandate that both players use a
        common bathroom, which Kramnik protested, resulting in <br>his forfeit of game five when he refused to play under those conditions.
         After negotiations, the original bathroom arrangements were reinstated123.<br>
         <br> Match Progression:<br> After an intense series of games, Kramnik and Topalov ended the classical portion of the match with a
          tied score of 6-6.<br> Kramnik had lost game five due to his forfeit but managed to recover by winning crucial games later on 12.<br>
          <br>Tiebreaks
          <br>      The tiebreak consisted of four rapid games with a time control of 25 minutes per side, plus a 10-second increment
           per move.<br> Kramnik won this mini-match decisively, securing his victory with a final score of 8½ to 7½ overall 13.<br><br>
      Conclusion<br>
      Kramnik's victory not only made him the undisputed World Chess Champion but also marked the end of a tumultuous period in <br>
      chess history characterized by division and controversy. His win was celebrated as a significant step towards restoring unity in <br>
      the chess world after years of fragmentation<br></p></p>
